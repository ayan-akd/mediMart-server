# Pedal Paradise Server

A backend server built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. This API handles bicycle inventory, orders, and revenue calculations. It supports CRUD operations for bicycles, manages orders with automatic stock updates, and integrates secure payment processing. The application also features role-based access control (RBAC) for user permissions and provides a robust error-handling mechanism to ensure stability and security.

## üìã Features

- **User Authentication & Management**: Secure user authentication with JWT-based authorization and role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Store Bicycle Data**: Store and manage bicycle details in the database.
- **Create, Read, Update, and Delete Bicycle Details**: Fully manage bicycle records via API endpoints.
- **Store Orders**: Create orders and automatically update the stock quantity.
- **Process Payments**: Integrate a secure payment gateway to handle transactions efficiently.
- **Calculate Total Revenue**: Calculate the total revenue generated from all orders.
- **Search Bicycles**: Retrieve bicycles based on query search terms.
- **Validate User Inputs**: Ensure data integrity using **Zod** for input validation.
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error messages for a better user experience.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Type annotations for reliability and maintainability of the application.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Use **Mongoose** to interact with MongoDB for efficient data handling and validation.
- **Code Linting & Formatting**: Enforce code quality with **ESLint** and **Prettier** for consistent code style.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (>=14.x.x)
- **MongoDB** (local or hosted, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- **Git**
- **TypeScript** (Optional: If you prefer to install globally)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayan-akd/b4-assignment-4-bicycle-store-server.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd b4-assignment-4-bicycle-store-server
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a .env file in the root directory based on the provided .env.example file. Update the necessary values according to your environment:

   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   etc..........
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

The server will run at http://localhost:5000 (or another port if you configure it differently).

## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts

The project includes several npm scripts for development and production:

- `npm run start`: Starts the application in production mode.
- `npm run start:dev`: Starts the application in development mode with live reloading using `ts-node-dev`.
- `npm run build`: Builds the production application.
- `npm run dev`: Watches for changes and compiles TypeScript files automatically.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using **ESLint**.
- `npm run lint:fix`: Automatically fixes linting errors.
- `npm run format`: Formats the codebase using **Prettier**.
- `npm run format:fix`: Automatically fixes formatting issues with **Prettier**.
